Q2 Write difference between var let and constant with example.
Ans.
1) Var is declaration is in the global scope or function scope. Let and const have a local scope.
2)Let and const are write in the block ( {...} ).
3)	a)Var can be update and redeclared withiin its scope.
	b)let can be updated but not re-declared.
	c)const variable cannot be updated nor redeclared.
4)var eg.
	var a=2;
	function newfun()
	{
		var  b=3;
		console.log(b); //output : 3
		console.log(a); //output : 2
	}   
	console.log(b); //output : error because it has function       				  scope
	console.log(a); //output : 2


  variable a is gobal scope and b is function scope.

5)  let x=3
                if(x==3)
                { 
                let x=4;
                console.log(x);//output :4
                }
                console.log(x);//output : 3
6)   const y=1;
     y=2;//error Assignment to constant variable.
	const a=5; 
     a=a+10;;//error Assignment to constant variable.
